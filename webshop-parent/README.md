# What?

This is a java/maven/scala/spring playground for testing these technologies and their tooling in various combinations.

# Known issues

- Commodities use a business key as the database key which means that commodities from different suppliers can't have 
the same name.

- Unit/integration tests are meant to verify key areas of functionality. Thus, while they verify functions such as
validation, CRUD and business logic, they don't do so exhaustively (i.e. they don't test the validation of _every_
field in _every_ entity).
